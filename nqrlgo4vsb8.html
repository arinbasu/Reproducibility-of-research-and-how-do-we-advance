<div>Let's get some clarity around the process. I want to work offline and online. I can use a web browser to write my text when I am online, but I use a plain text editor and nothing else when I am offline and working from my simple computer or a tablet device where I can store some of the files or access files from the web and nothing more. Here are the rules:</div><div></div><ul><li>Write in markdown your main text</li><li>Use a jupyter&nbsp; notebook to conduct data analysis ideally using python but optionally using R</li><li>Save the tables as csv files then do the following (see below)</li><li>Save the figures as jpg and do the following (see below)</li><li>Save the citations in bibliography/biblio.bib file as bibtex </li></ul><div></div>
